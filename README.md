We used a numerical method called "Value function iteration" that is based on successive approximations of the value function. It makes use of the contracting nature of the right-hand side of the optimality equation seen as an operator applied to bounded functions. The value function iteration finds an approximately optimal strategy and an approximation of the value function.

The Jupyter Notebook contains an example of application of this numerical method to, first, the Cake eating problem, then a Risk taking dilemma.
